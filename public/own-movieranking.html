<h1>Ultimate movie list</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>This is the ultimate comfort, fun, masterpiece of a movie. Damien Chazelle really went sicko mode
    on this one. The Cinematography is insane like every frame is beautiful. Even if you don't like
    musical, this movie WILL make you like musical.
    <p/>

<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
<p>
    This is the second movie of the "Before Trilogy". Even though the first movie is more famous and
    iconic, it's still not as amazing as this movie. What I love about it is the simplicity and the
    fact that it's very minimalistic but still delivers.

<h3>Almost Famous</h3>
<p>
    This is a new favorite and it made its jump to my top 3. I can't really pin point why I like this
    movie so much, I guess I was just very immersed in the storystelling, it's like I was the main character
